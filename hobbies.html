                <ul>
                    <li>After taking the Computer Science course at the tech school I found that I'm really passionate and enjoy coding</li>
                    <li>During my senior year I've learned that I really like Calculus, it is the first type of math that has interested me. 
                        I've started to learn new concepts on my own that relate to a project I've been doing in class
                    </li>
                    <li>My most passionate hobby is music. I played saxophone in band in middle school and really liked it, especially when I did jazz band. I stayed in it until freshman year,
                        I wasn't a huge fan of marching. However I really enjoyed pep band, I never imagined I could have that much fun playing an instrument. Unfortunately I 
                        had to drop out of band after freshman year because I wanted to focus on taking technology-based courses to be ready for college. 
                        I still play the saxophone every once in a while to practice or when I'm asked to perform at a church. I also started learning guitar, I've been taking lessons for about 2 years
                        and I play guitar in a bluegrass band with my family that goes to multiple different churches and performs. Recently I've found an interest in piano so I'm hoping
                        I can pursue that interest and learn how to play well.
