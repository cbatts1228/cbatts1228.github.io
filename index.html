                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Caden Batts and I am a senior in high school. I am taking Computer Science at the Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center. 
                    I've had a 4.0 GPA all the way through high school so I'm on track to be a valedictorian. I am good at managing my time and getting work done
                    which is why I was able to keep a 4.0 even while virtual for all of sophmore year. I am very outgoing so I have no trouble working with new people
                    on projects and being able to voice my opinions and ideas. Coding has become a passion and hobby for me and I'm positive that I want to be a software
                    engineer when I'm older.
