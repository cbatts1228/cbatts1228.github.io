            <h3>Plans after college</h3>
            <p>
                I'm not very sure what my plans are after college. I obviously want my job to be related to software. However, I'm not sure what exactly I want to do.
                I enjoyed doing web development during class, but the coding is a little tedious compared to other languages. I also like doing Java so maybe I could do 
                something with that. I think having a job in game development would be fun but I don't want to major in that since I don't think it would be very likely 
                for me to be able to find a job in game development.
